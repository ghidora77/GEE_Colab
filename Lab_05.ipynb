    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this tutorial is to establish a foundation for time series analysis on remotely sensed data. You will be introduced to the fundamentals of time series modeling, including decomposition, autocorrelation and modeling historical changes. At the completion of this tutorial, you will be able to build an explanatory model for temporal data which can be used in many different avenues of research.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the paradigm-changing features of Earth Engine is the ability to access decades of imagery without the previous limitation of needing to download, organize, store and process this information. For instance, within the Landsat image collection we can access imagery back to 1972, allowing us to look at an area to visualize and quantify how much it's changed over time. With Earth Engine, Google maintains the data and offers it's computing power for processing - users can access tens or hundreds of time-sequenced images and quantify change across decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explain the concepts of time series modeling, let's begin with a dataset that illustrates what we are trying to do. The line chart below references electricity production over thirty years, with one distinct data point per month. What can we observe?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Production tends to increase each year - In this case, it appears to level out after 2010, but there is a general trend upwards. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Within each yearly cycle, we see that there is a sharp peak in June and July, and a trough in October and December. An annual, 12-month cycle is specifically referred to as 'seasonality', although there can be other cyclical time periods (ex., a housing market in a specific area may see a recurring pattern in house prices that occurs roughly every 7 years)\n",
    "3. Finally, the magnitude of the difference between each yearly peak and trough increases over time as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Time Series Example](./im/im_05_01.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. With these observations, we can address each of the components individually and perhaps build an explanatory model. The time series decomposition below (generated in R) breaks up the data into separate components.\n",
    "   1. The 'observed' line chart is the data in original form.\n",
    "   2. The next chart is a trendline built using a window function (each data point is plotted as the average of the previous 12 data points). You can see the general trend of the data and determine whether a linear fit is appropriate.\n",
    "   3. The seasonal chart seeks to identify cyclical patterns in the data (in this case, patterns that repeat every 12 months). It subtracts the trend from the observed points and averages the data for each time period (month).\n",
    "   4. Finally, the 'random' line chart is the residual amount remaining when you remove the trend and seasonality from the data.\n",

    "### Limitations in Remote Sensing Time Series\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series modeling aims to build an explanatory model of the data without overfitting the problem set—to use as simple a model as possible while accounting for as much of the data as possible. The previous example was used to illustrate the concepts of breaking down time series data into component parts, but remote sensing data has additional limitations that make this more challenging. Note that in the previous example there was a well-formed data point for every single month—nothing was missing or obviously erroneous. It is almost inevitable that you will not get this same level of precision from remote sensing data. [Landsat-8](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/LANDSAT_LC08_C02_T1_L2) has 16-day temporal resolution, but depending on the area, removing cloudy pixels will remove a significant portion. In a test area in the Galapagos Islands, over 85% of the data was removed due to cloud masking or atmospheric conditions. Issues such as the [Landsat 7 Scan Line Corrector malfunction](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-landsat-7-etm-slc-data) might prevent a cohesive time series dataset depending on your time period of research. Also, while the time series example we used involved measured values on the same scale throughout the time series (e.g., a gigawatt is the same unit of measurement throughout the entire time series), with remote sensing we often run into situations where the magnitude of measurement changes. If we are researching winter crop yield and an image is collected right after a heavy snowfall, how do we compare this value? Do we keep this data or remove it? Additionally, atmospheric conditions can skew the visual results, where the hue of the vegetation changes drastically from image to image due to atmospheric conditions (fog, ground moisture, cloud cover).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand the characteristics of both your data and what you are trying to measure. Building a time series model to understand cyclical changes in vegetation can provide useful information in understanding crop yield, but if you do not account for issues in the data, you can end up building a time series model with erroneous results. Many time series modeling tools, such as [ARIMA modeling](https://otexts.com/fpp2/arima.html), are not directly applicable in certain settings due to missing data, non-standard collection periods and varying intensity due to atmospheric conditions. In this tutorial, we will focus on understanding linear trends and harmonic modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-Temporal Data in Earth Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series data in Earth Engine are represented as a series of images called '[Image Collections](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/ic_creating)'. As a result of the complicating factors in remote sensing discussed earlier, analyzing time series in Earth Engine is unlike time series modeling in traditional methods. From a programming sense, we will join data together to define temporal relationships between collection items and build functions to reduce this time.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, some very basic mathematical notation for time series. A time series is an array of the value being measured, sorted chronologically: $\\textbf{p}_{t}  = t_{0} + t_{1}... t_{N}$, where each *t* is the given value in the series.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preparation and Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in analysis of time series data is to import data of interest and plot the data around our region of interest, a deciduous forest near Blacksburg, VA, USA.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by loading in the Landsat 8 collection and provide a point at the region of interest. Additionally, we will create a time field."

    "A time series can be decomposed as the sum of sinusoids at different frequencies. The harmonic model presented here can be extended by adding bands that represent higher frequencies and the corresponding `sin()` band for a harmonic component to account for two cycles per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can look at this GEE [example](https://code.earthengine.google.com/f2f03989555d31cad7b532787531f275) of using multiple sinusoids to build a more complex harmonic model. Note that each year there is a high peak in June and a secondary peak in January—this harmonic model consisting of two sinusoids with separate frequencies and amplitudes is able to account for that. However, the error values in this model are high and the fit is quite inexact. We can see extreme drops in the NDVI value that the model misses, and several peaks each year that do not fit.\n",

    "Urban change detection is a burgeoning field in remote sensing that identifies historical urban development and works to predict where future urban development will occur. Remote sensing is a vital partner in this field, as it can provide an unbiased, quantitative assessment of change over time. For instance, [Greece](https://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/finding-swimming-pools-with-google-earth-greek-government-hauls-in-billions-in-back-taxes-a-709703.html) is using Google Earth Pro to scour the countryside for signs of tax evaders (ex., a luxury pool built without a permit may indicate sheltered money). Other countries are using classification models in Google Earth Engine to characterize urban development. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will go over a simple, but very effective method of identifying urban development, based on real-world experience. In nearby Roanoke (located about 45 minutes east of Virginia Tech), like any other city, there has been significant construction in the past few years. About three years ago, construction of an assisted living facility began on a patch of trees and pasture. Let's test to see if we can identify this construction. We will use the Landsat 8 image collection, and import our test point as `var roi`. The process of building the chart is the same as earlier, and we will use NDVI as our change metric, as we can hypothesize that new construction will greatly reduce NDVI. "

    "Below is the resulting chart, exactly as expected. NDVI has a max of 0.9 in the summer and a min of 0.4 in the winter, but between March 2018 to April 2018 the NDVI drops from 0.313 to 0.18, and largely stays below this value. In addition, the cyclicality is gone after 2018, and while there are some elevated values in late 2020, that is likely due to atmospheric conditions or sensor calibration. The linear trend is an indication of construction, and perhaps a window function to average out the variability can help identify large drops in the overall average NDVI for this test point. \n",

Global Forest Watch is using a similar tactic to automatically detect when there is a large drop in NDVI, and by using MODIS data, they can obtain very high temporal resolution to identify exactly when and where this activity is occurring. Note that different image collections have different timelines (for instance, Landsat 8 would not be able to detect urban change before 2013), and you may have to set up this system differently for different satellite platforms. \n",
