    "# Lab 06 - Nighttime Lights Appendix\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Capturing and visualizing low-light emittance from around the earth has been utilized in various applications since the mid-1960's. By consistently quantifying light emittance over long time periods, it is possible to use this as a proxy for economic development, especially in areas where there is not high-quality data and metrics to work with. Google Earth Engine has consolidated this data into an operational archive dating back to 1992, which provides unparallelled support for finding meaningful insights using this data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is a supplement to the *Open Nighttime Lights* [tutorial](https://worldbank.github.io/OpenNightLights/welcome.html) that the World Bank developed. The World Bank tutorial consists of six modules, including a background on the history of the data, working with the tools, extracting imagery, data analysis and image classification. It also contains an archive in which you can archive the raw data directly from Amazon Web Services and an applications section that attempts to estimate electricity usage using the nighttime data set. Each segment is well-written, and there is extensive documentation throughout. \n",
    "\n",
    "The caveat here is that up until this point in the course, we have worked with the Google Earth Engine JavaScript code editor - Because the World Bank tutorial covers topics such as working with data frames, statistics and classification, it utilizes the Google Earth Engine Python API in a Jupyter Notebook. Python is a more natural fit and contains more capabilities for data analysis and Machine Learning than JavaScript, and while the GEE code editor is excellent for working with objects and methods, many of you might prefer working with Python. Based on your background and what you want to get out of this course, here is our general suggestion on how to proceed. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you are comfortable working with Python, Jupyter Notebooks and setting up your own environment (pip, Conda, Brew), then follow along with the tutorial as it is. Module 2-2 in the World Bank tutorial explains how to get an environment up and running.\n",
    "   1. If this is the case, spend some time reading about the functionality in the [geemap](https://geemap.org) package - it consolidates much of the mapping features in Earth Engine in an intuitive way, as well as functionality to integrate your results with Folium and custom basemaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If you want to learn to use Python but have never worked with virtual environments, then consider going through the tutorial in a Google Colab - it requires no setup of infrastructure, and you can get running immediately while learning Python. Once you are comfortable with this, you can always learn how to set up your own environment. Explanations on getting started can be located [here](https://worldbank.github.io/OpenNightLights/tutorials/mod2_3_introduction_to_Jupyter_notebooks.html). Note that there are several components of the tutorial, primarily in visualization using leaflet, that will not work. \n",
    "3. If you want to stick with working with JavaScript, then the section below will provide you with some capabilities of doing the core functions in the code editor, mainly the segment in Module 3. After that, we suggest exporting the data for further analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Again, this lab is more of a supplement for students that wish to keep using JavaScript and the GEE code editor. It is not designed to fully replace the World Bank tutorial, and while will get you started, there will be things that you will have to figure out on your own. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Operations \n",
    "\n",
    "Module 1 is an essential introduction to the NightTime Lights dataset, while Module 2 introduces you to the data and the setting up your environment. In this section, we will covering the essential components of obtaining the data that you need in the correct context, some basic processing, building a composite and exporting the data  in JavaScript, with enough code to show you how to get started and how to follow along with the tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will follow along with module exactly as it is set up,  so that you can refer to the Module and section numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Obtaining the Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "   The code chunk below should be a good starting point on ingesting the data, looking at the range of data, and visualizing the average value across the image collection. Follow along with the same concepts in the tutorial, test using a specific image (instead of an image collection) and visualize your results. You can modify the opacity manually using the slider on the `layers` tab, and then build it into your [visualization](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/image_visualization?hl=en#code-editor-javascript).\n",
    "\n",
    "   Note: JavaScript uses Lon / Lat, while Python uses lat / long while building points or setting map areas. \n",

We will go over scaling an image to center each pixel at zero. We are working in the region of East Timor - the general process is to read in the December 2017 Nighttime Lights average, clip it to the East Timor Feature Collection, and then calculate the mean and standard deviation using the `reduceRegion` function. Now that we have those values, we can standardize the scaling. Compare the before and after images - in the first, it is very difficult to get any meaningful values, because the range of values is so narrow. Once scaled, we can more easily differentiate between urban areas and rural areas. You will also note that by doing this, the noise increases as well, as you can tell from the reduced 'sharpness' of the image. This can be an issue in many cases, and will be addressed in other components of the module. "

This works well for that specific use case, but is limiting when you need to use operations that are not specifically provided within GEE. Another methodology is to build our expression with a string and then provide the input as a key-value pair. See the code chunk below for the methodology. Additionally, for calculations that involve massive amounts of data, there are some speed advantages in doing it this way. Follow along with the World Bank tutorial using this methodology, and try to build some of your own functions to see the result.
