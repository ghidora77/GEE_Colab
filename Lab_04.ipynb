    "# Lab 04 - Classification \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab will cover the process of using machine learning (ML) to create both unsupervised and supervised classification models for land use categorization. We will discuss the methodology involved and potential use cases, explore parameter tuning and go through the process of building a relatively simple classification model using Random Forest and CART, which you can use as a starting point for future research.   \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is possible for a human to look at a satellite image and identify objects or land cover types based on their visual characteristics, the sheer magnitude and volume of imagery makes it virtually impossible to do this manually at scale. To compensate, machine learning allows computers to process this information much quicker than a human and find meaningful insights in the imagery. Image classification is an essential component in today's remote sensing, and there are many opportunities in this growing field. By training ML models to efficiently process the data and return labeled information, we can focus on the higher-level insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Earth Engine offers many options to work with classification. Most broadly, we can separate classification into two parts - supervised and unsupervised classification. We will introduce both components and work our way through several examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "For practical purposes, we can define pixel-wise prediction as guessing the value of some geographic variable of interest `g`, using a function `G` that takes as input a pixel vector **`p`**:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "G_{t}(p_{i}) = g_{i}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The *i* in this equation refers to a particular instance from a set of pixels. Think of *G* as a guessing function and $g_{i}$ as the guess for pixel *i*.  The **T** in the subscript of *G* refers to a *training set* (a set of known values for **p** and the correct *g*), used to infer the structure of *G*. You have to choose a suitable *G* to train with **T**. \n",
    "\n",
    "When `g` is nominal, or a fixed category (ex., {'water', 'vegetation', 'bare'}), we call this classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "When `g` is numeric (ex., {0, 1, 2, 3}), we call this regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simplistic description of a problem addressed in a broad range of fields including mathematics, statistics, data mining and machine learning. For our purposes, we will go through some examples using these concepts in Google Earth Engine and then provide more resources for further reading at the end. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Unsupervised Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised classification finds unique groupings in the dataset without manually developed training data (no guidance). The computer will cycle through the pixels, look at the characteristics of the different bands, and pixel-by-pixel begin to group information together. Perhaps pixels with a blue hue and a low NIR value are grouped together, while green-dominant pixels are also grouped together. The outcome of unsupervised classification is that each pixel is categorized within the context of the image and the number of categories specified. Take note that the number of clusters is set by the user, and this plays a major role in how the algorithm operates. Too many clusters create unnecessary noise, while too few clusters does not have yield enough granularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Earth Engine provides [documentation](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/clustering) on working with unsupervised classification within their ecosystem, and we will be focusing on the `ee.Clusterer` package, which provides a flexible unsupervised classification (or clustering) in an easy-to-use way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clusterers are used in the same manner as classifiers in Earth Engine. The general workflow for clustering is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assemble features with numeric properties to find clusters\n",
    "2. Instantiate a clusterer - set its parameters if necessary\n",
    "3. Train the clusterer using the training data\n",
    "4. Apply the clusterer to an image or feature collection\n",
    "5. Label the clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by creating a study region - in this case we will be working in an area near Blacksburg, VA.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be working with Landsat 8 imagery, which we will filter to the region and to the year of 2019. `maskl8sr()` is a function used to mask out cloud pixels. Visualize the true color image first to get an understanding of the region. \n",

    "\n",
    "The previous section asked the question whether the result is satisfactory or not. In remote sensing, the quantification of the answer is called accuracy assessment. In the regression context, a standard measure of accuracy is the [Root Mean Square Error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation) (RMSE) or the [correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence) between known and predicted values. (Although the RMSE is returned by the linear regression reducer, beware: this is computed from the training data and is NOT a fair estimate of expected prediction error when guessing a pixel not in the training set). It is testing how accurate the model is based on the existing training data, but proper methodology uses separate ground-truth values for testing. In the classification context, accuracy measurements are often derived from a [confusion matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to partition the set of known values into training and testing sets. Reusing the classification training set, add a column of random numbers used to partition the known data where about 60% of the data will be used for training and 40% for testing. Train the classifier with the trainingSet, classify the testing set and get a confusion matrix. Note that the classifier automatically adds a property called 'classification', which is compared to the 'class' property added when you imported your polygons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Print the confusion matrix and expand the object to inspect the matrix. The entries represent the number of pixels. Items on the diagonal represent correct classification and items off the diagonal are misclassifications, where the class in row *i* is classified as column *j* \n",
