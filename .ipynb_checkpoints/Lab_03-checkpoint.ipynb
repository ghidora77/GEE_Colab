    "# Lab 03 - Spectral Indices & Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will work with the spectral characteristics in our data to visualize and extract insights that go beyond basic visual interpretation. We will work with the different spectral bands offered by Landsat 8 to find unique patterns that can help us solve problems and conduct analysis. By the end of this lab, you should be able to understand how to build and visualize existing indices, as well as construct your own, identify how different indices can help your use case, and understand the mechanism behind how they work. \n",

    "## Spectral Indices\n",
    "\n",
    "Spectroscopy is the study of how radiation is absorbed, reflected and emitted by different materials. While this discipline has its origins in chemistry and physics, we can utilize the same techniques to identify different land cover types from satellite data.  In the chart below, land cover types have unique spectral characteristics. Snow has a major peak at lower wavelengths and is near zero above 1.5 micrometer, whereas soil has very low reflectance at lower levels of wavelength but relatively strong and steady reflectance after ~0.75 micrometers. Spectral indices are built to leverage these unique characteristics and isolate specific types of land cover. \n",
    "\n",
    "Land covers are separable at different wavelengths. Vegetation curves (green) have high reflectance in the NIR range, where radiant energy is scattered by cell walls ([Bowker, 1985](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19850022138.pdf)) and low reflectance in the red range, where radiant energy is [absorbed by chlorophyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophyll#/media/File:Chlorophyll_ab_spectra-en.svg). We can leverage this information to build indices that help us differentiate vegetation from urban areas. In the next few sections, we will cover several of the most important indices in use. \n",

    "#### Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has a [long history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_Difference_Vegetation_Index) in remote sensing, and is one of the most widely used measures. The typical formulation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{NDVI} = (\\text{NIR} - \\text{red}) / (\\text{NIR} + \\text{red})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where *NIR* refers to the near infrared band and *red* refers to the red peak in the visible spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because NDVI is a popular and well-known index, we can use the built-in functionality within Earth Engine `normalizedDifference()`to calculate NDVI. You can follow the steps below to build your own indices. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, build a baseline true color image around our region of interest, Blacksburg, VA. We will work with the Landsat 8 Collection 1 Tier 1 TOA Reflectance data from 2015, sort by cloud cover and extract the first image."

    "\n",
    "The Normalized Burn Ratio Thermal (NBRT) was developed based on the idea that burned land has low NIR reflectance (less vegetation), high SWIR reflectance (think ash), and high brightness temperature ([Holden et al. 2005](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01431160500239008)). Unlike the other indices, a lower NBRT means a higher likelihood of recent burn (for visualization, reverse the scale). This index can be used to diagnose the severity of wildfires (see [van Wagtendonk et al. 2004](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003442570400152X))."

As a result, the principal components are uncorrelated. To demonstrate, use the Landsat 8 image converted to an array image.

The next step is to compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of that covariance matrix. Since the eigenvalues are appended to the eigenvectors, slice the two apart and discard the eigenvectors. Perform the matrix multiplication, as with the TC components. Finally, convert back to a multi-band image and display the first PC.\n",

Filtering an image can be useful for extracting image information at different [spatial frequencies](http://www.dspguide.com/ch24/5.htm) by reducing noise. For this reason, smoothing filters are called *low-pass* filters (they let *low*-frequency data *pass* through) and edge detection filters are called *high-pass* filters. To implement filtering in Earth Engine use [image.convolve()](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/image_convolutions) with an ee.Kernel for the argument."

In the following, use kernels with radius defined in meters except to visualize the weights."
